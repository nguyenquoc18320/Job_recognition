# Job_recognition
Goal: The project is create to recognize a job (in 10 jobs) in an image.

Description:
  + 10 jobs: []
  + Trained models are stored in model folder, we can use them right to test
 
Results:
  + Model2: based on ResNet Architecture and achieve accuracy over 70% on test set.
  + Model3: also based on ResNet Architecture but it is lightly deeper than model2, so the accuracy on test set is as same as one of model2.
